Debugging information for Nonpareil

When using GDB to debug Nonpareil, sometimes GDB will stop with a
message "Program received signal SIG33, Real-time event 33.".

You can give the command "handle SIG33 nostop noprint", then continue.

In case you're wondering, a SIG33 is a German tank with a 150 mm
howitzer.  Naturally GDB is somewhat taken aback upon encountering one.
