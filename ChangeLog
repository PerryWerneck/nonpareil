	Added automatic dependency generation.

1995-03-23  Eric Smith <eric@telebit.com>

	* Reluctantly changed the names of source files from
	casm.l and casm.y to casml.l and casmy.y.  It seems that many
	systems have stupid default make rules that would try to build
	casm.c from casm.l or casm.y if the latter are newer.  Previously
	I had a line ".SUFFIXES:" in the Makefile to prevent the default
	rules from being used, but this only works with GNU make or BSD
	make.

	* CHANGELOG: Created this CHANGELOG file and added it to MISC in
	the Makefile.
