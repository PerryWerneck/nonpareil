950323:	Reluctantly changed the names of source files from casm.l and casm.y to
	casml.l and casmy.y.  It seems that many systems have stupid default
	make rules that would try to build casm.c from casm.l or casm.y if the
	latter are newer.  Previously I had a line ".SUFFIXES:" in the
	Makefile to prevent the default rules from being used, but this only
	works with GNU make or BSD make.

	Created this CHANGELOG file and added it to MISC in the Makefile.
