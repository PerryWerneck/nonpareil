2003-05-29  Eric Smith  <eric@brouhaha.com>

	* Makefile: Changed names of intermediate targets generated by
	bison and flex: instead of using the old yacc and lex default
	filenames, use filenames derived from the source file base names.
	Default location of X11 stuff is in /usr/X11R6.
	Added automatic dependency generation.

	* hp45.asm: Corrected typo found by Peter Monta.

	* ChangeLog: Renamed from CHANGELOG and reformatted entries as per
	conventions.

1995-03-23  Eric Smith <eric@telebit.com>

	* Reluctantly changed the names of source files from
	casm.l and casm.y to casml.l and casmy.y.  It seems that many
	systems have stupid default make rules that would try to build
	casm.c from casm.l or casm.y if the latter are newer.  Previously
	I had a line ".SUFFIXES:" in the Makefile to prevent the default
	rules from being used, but this only works with GNU make or BSD
	make.

	* CHANGELOG: Created this CHANGELOG file and added it to MISC in
	the Makefile.
