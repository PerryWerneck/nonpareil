2004-04-12  Eric Smith <eric@brouhaha.com>

	* arch.h arch.c: Replaced arch name table with struct arch_info_t
	and get_arch_info().

	* model.h model.c: Added clock frequency to model_info_t.

2004-04-11  Eric Smith <eric@brouhaha.com>

	* proc_woodstock.c (op_load_constant): Fix pointer wrap.

	* proc_woodstock.c (op_dec_p, op_inc_p): Increment and decrement P
	instructions wrap at word size, rather than setting P to an
	invalid position.

2004-04-10  Eric Smith <eric@brouhaha.com>

	* proc_woodstock.c (woodstock_handle_io): If the display is
	disabled, fill the string with spaces.
	
	* proc_woodstock.c (decode_woodstock_display): Add a trailing null
	character to the string.
	
2004-04-09  Eric Smith <eric@brouhaha.com>

	* proc_woodstock.c (woodstock_parse_object_line): Handle a
	five-digit octal address as a single-digit bank and four-digit
	address.

	* proc_woodstock.c (woodstock_print_state,
	woodstock_execute_instruction): Move call to
	woodstock_disassemble() into woodstock_print_state().

	* proc_woodstock.c (woodstock_print_state): Use env->prev_pc
	rather than env->pc, since PC has already been incremented.

	* proc_woodstock.c (op_arith, op_load_constant): When printing
	warning messages about P out of range, call
	woodstock_print_state().  Don't suppress message about loading an
	out of range P value, as the HP-45 is not a Woodstock.

	* proc_woodstock.c (woodstock_disassemble): Print opcode in octal
	rather than decimal.

	* proc_woodstock.c (woodstock_handle_io): Split display decode
	into multiple functions dispatched based on platform.  Implemented
	display decode for Spice platform.

	* csim.c (main) proc.c (sim_init) proc.h proc_int.h: Added
	platform field to sim_t.
	
	* model.c: Set RAM size for Spice models for which it is known,
	and ifdef'd out the models for which it isn't.
	
	* platform.h platform.c (find_platform_by_name): Added
	find_platform_by_name().

	* proc_woodstock.c (op_circulate_a_left, init_ops): Implemented
	0520 as CIRCULATE A LEFT instruction.  This is confirmed to be
	correct for the HP-33C (Spice), so it probably is for Woodstock as
	well.
	
2004-04-08  Eric Smith <eric@brouhaha.com>

	* proc_woodstock.c (op_clear_data_regs): The CLEAR DATA REGISTERS
	instruction only clears the single selected RAM chip (16
	registers).

	* proc.c proc.h proc_int.h proc_classic.h proc_woodstock.c csim.c:
	Added debug_flags field to sim_t, and sim_set_debug_flag() and
	sim_get_debug_flag() to control them.  Added debug menu commands
	to toggle debug flags.  All conditional on HAS_DEBUGGER.

	* proc_classic.c (classic_execute_instruction) proc_woodstock.c
	(woodstock_execute_instruction) proc_int.h: When tracing, call
	disassemble function if source code is not loaded.

	* proc_classic.c proc_woodstock.c (bad_op): Print opcode of
	illegal instructions in octal rather than hexadecimal.

	warnings.

	* asm.c (err_vprintf): Only output messages to listing file during
	pass 2.

	* asm.c (format_listing): Use return value from sprintf() to avoid
	unnecessary use of strlen().

	* wasml.l wasmy.y: Many fixes to Woodstock assembler; now HP-25
	source code assembles with no reported errors and object code
	matches listing.
	
	* asm.h asm.c casmy.y wasmy.y: Added a global symbol table for
	symbols starting with a '$'.
	
	* symtab.h symtab.c asm.h asm.c: Cleaned up typedefs, and use separate
	structs/typedefs for symbol table and symbol.

2004-04-03  Eric Smith <eric@brouhaha.com>

	* wasml.l wasmy.y Makefile: Started development of Woodstock

	specify background color for window, useful with transparent
	images when not in shape mode.

	* proc.c (sim_thread_func): Try harder to maintain nominal rate
	of microinstructions per second.

	problems.

	* kml.h kml.c kmll.l kmly.y: Added KML file parser.

2004-01-12  Eric Smith <eric@brouhaha.com>

	* hp35.asm: Replaced octal branch targets with labels.  Copied

2003-06-02  Peter Monta

	* hp35.asm: Dissassembled code extracted by peeling chips

2003-05-30  Eric Smith  <eric@brouhaha.com>

2003-05-30  Peter Monta

	* hp55.asm: Corrected typos

	* xio.c: HP-35 and HP-55 keyboard support

2003-05-29  Eric Smith  <eric@brouhaha.com>

	* Makefile: Changed names of intermediate targets generated by
	bison and flex: instead of using the old yacc and lex default
	filenames, use filenames derived from the source file base names.
	Default location of X11 stuff is in /usr/X11R6.
	Added automatic dependency generation.

	* hp45.asm: Corrected typo found by Peter Monta.

	* ChangeLog: Renamed from CHANGELOG and reformatted entries as per
	conventions.

1995-03-23  Eric Smith <eric@telebit.com>

	* Reluctantly changed the names of source files from
	casm.l and casm.y to casml.l and casmy.y.  It seems that many
	systems have stupid default make rules that would try to build
	casm.c from casm.l or casm.y if the latter are newer.  Previously
	I had a line ".SUFFIXES:" in the Makefile to prevent the default
	rules from being used, but this only works with GNU make or BSD
	make.

	* CHANGELOG: Created this CHANGELOG file and added it to MISC in
	the Makefile.
