Bugs:

  Button presses missed

  HP-45: Anomalous stopwatch display (aliasing?)

  HP-80: Multiplication doesn't work


Building:

  Create an RPM .spec file.


User interface:

  Use KML file.

  Make display area larger.  Same size digits, just set more background around
  them.

  Keyboard events, at least for numeric entry, basic four functions, and enter.

  Implement menu commands:
      File - Open, Save, save As
      Edit - Copy, Paste

  Make button hilighting look better.

  Add help.

  Create an icon.

  Calculator model selection at runtime.

  Create a fancier About box.


Internals:

  Add a debugger.

  Split ALU functions into separate source file.

  Create a CPU class, with subclasses for classic, woodstock,
  spice/spike, and nut/voyager.

  Clean up memory usage of symbols in CASM

  Implement symbol cross-reference in CASM

  It would be nice to use a pure parser for KML, pass in the kml_t
  pointer as input, and return it from read_kml_file().  But Flex
  doesn't yet seem to have support for the Bison pure_parser option.
  There exist patches, but I don't want to make people use those.
  Better to wait for a production release of Flex.


Better model support:

  Model-dependent RAM size.

  Scan images.

  Key in partial HP-65 source code from patent.

  Implement HP-65, HP-70, HP-80 keyboard legends.

  Dump actual HP-45, HP-55, HP-65, HP-70, HP-80 ROMs.

  Compare actual HP-45 and HP-55 ROMs to CASM output.

  Add HP-65 microinstructions for program memory access.


Ports:

  Windows

  MacOS X
