TODO list for CASMSIM

Build process:

  Create an RPM .spec file.


User interface:

  Transparency/shape: improve support for moving window: add KML
  syntax to specify keyboard rectangle, and use only region outside
  rectangle for dragging.

  Improve keyboard support:
      Release key when focus is lost.
      Ignore key release and hold key for a fixed (configurable?) number of
          simulation cycles?

  Improve KML file utilization, particularly for display.

  Implement menu commands:
      File - Open, Save, save As
      Edit - Copy, Paste

  Make button highlighting look better.

  Make slide switches look better.

  Add help.

  Create an icon.

  Calculator model selection at runtime.

  Create a fancier About box.


Internals:

  Use io_count to improve display update timing.

  Add a debugger.

  Split ALU functions into separate source file.

  Create a CPU class, with subclasses for classic, woodstock,
  cricket, spice/spike, and nut/voyager.

  Replace globals in csim.c with structure.  Allow for multiple instances.

  Clean up memory usage of symbols in CASM

  Implement symbol cross-reference in CASM

  It would be nice to use a pure parser for KML, pass in the kml_t
  pointer as input, and return it from read_kml_file().  But Flex
  doesn't yet seem to have support for the Bison pure_parser option.
  There exist patches, but I don't want to make people use those.
  Better to wait for a production release of Flex.


Better model support:

  Scan images.

  Implement HP-65, HP-70, HP-80 keyboard legends.

  Dump actual HP-45, HP-55, HP-65, HP-70, HP-80 ROMs.

  Compare actual HP-45 and HP-55 ROMs to CASM output.

  Add HP-65 microinstructions for program memory access.


Ports:

  Windows

  MacOS X
