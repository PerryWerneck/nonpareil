Build process:

  Create an RPM .spec file.


User interface:

  More general proc_xxx to display interface, to support Spice comma (digit
  grouping), and Nut and Voyager displays.

  Transparency/shape: improve support for moving window: add KML
  syntax to specify keyboard rectangle, and use only region outside
  rectangle for dragging.

  Improve keyboard support:
      Release key when focus is lost.
      Ignore key release and hold key for a fixed (configurable?) number of
          simulation cycles?

  Implement menu commands:
      File - Open, Save, save As
      Edit - Copy, Paste

  Make button highlighting look better.

  Make slide switches look better.

  Add help.

  Create an icon.

  Calculator model selection at runtime.

  Create a fancier About box.


Internals:

  Merge Nut CPU code from NSIM.

  Use io_count to improve display update timing.

  Add reflection API for use by debugger (both GUI and command line).

  Add register window.

  Add debugger commands.  Pass dbt_t as arg to commands.

  Change Tcl standard I/O streams to use pty file descriptor.

  Split ALU functions into separate source file.

  Replace globals in csim.c with structure.  Allow for multiple instances.

  Clean up memory usage of symbols in CASM

  Implement symbol cross-reference in CASM

  It would be nice to use a pure parser for KML, pass in the kml_t
  pointer as input, and return it from read_kml_file().  But Flex
  doesn't yet seem to have support for the Bison pure_parser option.
  There exist patches, but I don't want to make people use those.
  Better to wait for a production release of Flex.


Better model support:

  Scan images at uniform scale and without JPEG compression.

  Dump actual Classic, Woodstock, Topcat, Sting, HP-67, HP-31E, HP-33E ROMs.

  Compare actual HP-45 and HP-55 ROMs to CASM output.

  Add HP-65 microinstructions for program memory access.
